        <p>
            I'm Casey, but my art handle is Scratch. I'm a CGI artist, writer, programmer and voice actor, and I actually designed this entire website myself. I don't mean with an online tool either, I wrote all the source code on my laptop. But I digress. Anyways, here's a bit more about me. I like pastel colors, my favorite being purple. I like animals, especially cats, and I love computers. I have learned several programming languages, including Python, BaSH, C++, JavaScript, HTML/CSS, PHP, SQL, and a few others. My 3D software of choice is Blender, since it's free and high quality. If you're just getting into computer graphics, I highly recommend using Blender. I typically make my art either lopoly or photoreal, and I love to use bright colors, because they make my art fun to look at. Thanks for taking the time to read all of this! If you haven't already, check out my Portfolios, because that's where my art is. There's a tab for it in the navbar!
